# GitHub Pages Setup for Teaching Portfolio

1. Rename your main HTML file to `index.html` (GitHub Pages requires this as the entry point).
2. Push all your files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, images, etc.) to a GitHub repository.
3. In your repository, go to Settings > Pages.
4. Under "Source", select the branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the root (`/`) folder.
5. Save. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Quick Rename
If your file is currently named `Teaching Portfolio.html`, rename it to `index.html` before uploading to GitHub.
